#In this example, we will first have to taint a certain node.
#Run command kubectl get nodes to determine the nodes in your cluster.
#Now hypothetically taint the node with the following commmand.
#kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
#Above command means that there is a taint and that unless a Pod shows a toleration to the taint it can
#not be scheduled on this node.
#Now in this definition file, we will add a toleration to the pod, if toleration matches the taint then
#it can be scheduled. Pods who do not match the taint will not be scheduled and already running pod will
#be evicted fro the node.
#Get taints on node kubectl describe node <node-name>
#If you want to un-taint the master and start scheduling pods on it
#run kubectl taint nodes master node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule-
